Crow used to work as a school teacher and was the owner of Creative Artists Management in Manhattan.

He released <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/21/tony-bennett-dead-dies-singer/>over 70 albums</a> which won him 19 Grammys.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, the singer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016, and his wife was his caregiver until his last breath. Bennett had one of his last interviews on "60 Minutes" and could hardly hold a conversation.</p><p class=dh>But despite his illness, Bennett still wanted to get back on stage. When asked about one of his performances with singer Lady Gaga, the singer did not seem to remember.</p><p class=dh>Crow was there to lead most of the conversation, but one thing the singer is said to have always remembered was his name.

Even though things were tough, Crow felt they were fortunate in many ways. Crow and Bennett were last spotted walking together in New York.

One of the reasons Crow felt that their family was lucky was because of the amount of help they received.</p><p class=dh>She credited one of the singer's sons, Danny, for managing Bennett's business affairs as well as the amazing team of medical doctors that helped him. Crow was also grateful that her husband always remembered who she and his children were.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dadf8f9e3573958b7e23bbc5c6b8632112c2d934bf71338364afd8899c391adc.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tony Bennett in California in 2017 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Bennett was born in Astoria, Queens, on August 3, 1926, and left an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://people.com/music/who-is-susan-benedetto-tony-bennett-wife/#:~:text=She%20explained%20that,he%20still%20is.%22">impact with his music</a>.
