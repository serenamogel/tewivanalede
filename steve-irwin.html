Irwin's work spawned an array of merchandise tie-ins. He was killed by a stingray during a diving expedition on September 4, 2006, off the coast of Port Douglas in Queensland, Australia.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Irwin was born on February 22, 1962, in Essendon, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Part wildlife expert and part entertainer, Irwin became world-famous for his TV series The Crocodile Hunter, among other nature programs. While he had no scientific degree, he grew up studying and caring for animals at his parents' wildlife park, which is now known as the Australia Zoo. He first learned how to catch and handle his beloved crocodiles from his father and once received a python as a birthday present.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Crocodile Hunter' Premieres</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Irwin met American-born Terri Raines, who in was in Australia on vacation, in 1991. The couple later married and spent part of their honeymoon filming crocodiles. This footage became part of their 1992 Australian TV show The Crocodile Hunter. Four years later, the series was picked up by the American cable network Animal Planet. At the peak of its popularity, the show aired in more than 200 countries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Audiences were often spellbound by Irwin's dangerous encounters with animals on the series. He thought nothing of tangling with deadly snakes, spiders, lizards, and, of course, crocodiles. In addition to his hair-raising adventures, Irwin considered himself a wildlife educator, sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm for animals with his viewers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Always in his trademark khaki shirt and shorts, Irwin became a well-known figure in popular culture. He even had his own catchphrase—"Crikey!"—an Australian expression of surprise or excitement. There have been countless parodies and spoofs of the famed adventurer—even The Simpsons and South Park featured send-ups of Irwin. He wasn't afraid to poke fun at his image as an energetic naturalist and showman. Irwin appeared as himself in the 2001 film Dr. Dolittle 2 with Eddie Murphy. The following year, Irwin and his wife starred in their own film, The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Controversy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Irwin occasionally drew criticism for his stunts. Some said that he was exploiting the animals that appeared on his shows. He stirred up even greater controversy in 2004 for feeding a crocodile while holding his infant son. Many were shocked by the images of Irwin and his son Robert with the snapping crocodile and accused Irwin of child endangerment. Irwin was never charged in regard to this incident and stated that his son was never in harm's way. He had grown up in a zoo environment and wanted the same experience for his son, Robert, and his daughter, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/bindi-irwin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bindi Sue" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bindi Sue</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tragic Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On September 4, 2006, Irwin was filming a new program off the coast of Port Douglas in Queensland, Australia. Snorkeling near a stingray, he was pierced in the chest by its barb, which hit his heart. Irwin died of cardiac arrest shortly after being stung.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stunned by the news of his sudden death, people around the world mourned his passing. Many left flowers and notes at the Australia Zoo, which he and his wife ran, taking over for his parents. Others posted messages expressing their grief on the Web. Wildlife experts, such as Jack Hanna, noted that Irwin was a great conservationist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Irwin continues to be remembered today for his many contributions to the field of wildlife education and conservation, including running an organization to rescue and protect crocodiles and supporting numerous other animal charities. November 15 has been designated Steve Irwin Day, an international tribute held annually in recognition of his life and work.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Irwin</li><li>Birth Year: 1962</li><li>Birth date: February 22, 1962</li><li>Birth City: Essendon, Melbourne, Victoria</li><li>Birth Country: Australia</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Steve Irwin was a famous Australian wildlife enthusiast who was at the helm of the popular 'Crocodile Hunter' series.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Television</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Pisces</li><li>Nacionalities</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Australian</li></ul><li>Death Year: 2006</li><li>Death date: September 4, 2006</li><li>Death City: Near Port Douglas, Queensland</li><li>Death Country: Australia</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=23><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Steve Irwin Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/steve-irwin</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: August 26, 2022</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I get called an adrenaline junkie every other minute, and I'm just fine with that.</li><li>Yeah, I'm a thrill seeker, but crikey, education's the most important thing.</li><li>I have no fear of losing my life—if I have to save a koala or a crocodile or a kangaroo or a snake, mate, I will save it.</li><li>Crikey!</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVoqq2dppp6qr7WoqU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./t-j-miller-wont-be-in-deadpool-3-due-to-ryan-reynolds.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>T.J.
