The terrifically versatile <a href=#>Chloë Grace Moretz</a> plays Cameron, bringing out both her character’s youthful curiosity and precocious maturity. This is the pre-marriage-equality era when liberals slapped “Clinton/Gore” stickers on their vehicles; before mainstream Hollywood and cable TV earnestly stepped in with stories of LGBTQ acceptance; and a time where the ripple effects of the AIDS crisis that unjustly spread hateful rhetoric on homosexuality were deeply lived and felt. But almost like a quiet revolutionary, Cameron somehow seems to know better than hating herself, despite the odds that are stacked against her. She proves to have a stubbornly strong head on her shoulders—she shows us as much early in the film, when she looks at the dressed-up image of her prettified self in the mirror with foreign eyes and wipes off the excess lipstick her adoptive mother (or a family member, possibly an aunt) had dotingly put on her moments ago.</p><p>All that prep is for Cameron’s high school prom, during which she will be caught passionately making out with the prom queen Coley Taylor (<a href=#>Quinn Shephard</a> of “<a href=#>Blame</a>”) in the backseat of a car, sealing her fate with a stay at a facility known as “God’s Promise.” There, Cameron becomes known as a disciple, joining a group of other male and female disciples trying to “cure” their SSA (same-sex attraction). That’s what the leaders of the facility—the stern, Nurse-Ratchet-like Dr. Lydia Marsh (<a href=#>Jennifer Ehle</a>, quietly terrifying with her fake smile) and her visibly oppressed, “ex-gay” brother Reverend Rick (John Gallagher Jr.) call homosexuality. In fact, Dr. Marsh goes as far as stating, “there is no such thing as homosexuality.” Tasking all disciples with gradually filling out their personality icebergs—an exercise aiming to surface the kids’ supposed reasons to engage in SSA—she systemically breaks down their will to exist in the way they were born.</p><p>But despite all the silent emotional abuse, Cameron knows she’s just a perfectly normal teenager responding to her natural, budding desires. This unique awareness both surrounds her with an invisible shield (a fellow disciple even accuses her of being arrogantly closed off), and unites her with likeminded teens, also biding their time to leave the facility. One of them is <a href=#>Jane Fonda</a> (no, really), played by “<a href=#>American Honey</a>”’s <a href=#>Sasha Lane</a>, who brings a vivacious blend of sarcasm and vulnerability to the role. The other is Adam Red Eagle (<a href=#>Forrest Goodluck</a> of “<a href=#>The Revenant</a>”), Jane’s best friend and only ally. Soon enough, the makeshift trio forms an unbreakable bond; going on frequent hikes, smoking plenty of weed (which Jane grows out in the woods and hides in her prosthetic leg) and faking their way through various therapy sessions with bogus contributions. Cameron in due course learns what she’s supposed to say to please Dr. Marsh, who perennially looks to be stuck in a different era with her matronly, ‘80s-channeling outfits. Like a lying inmate fishing for parole, Cameron blames her SSA on masculine sports one day; and claims to have mixed up “wanting to be Coley” with “being attracted to her,” the next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lnZ7AprDUnJitoZ%2BjerCyjJyYpp2ipLtuvM6sq2ZqYGaF</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erica-herman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erica Herman- Net worth, Husband, Bio, Age, Height, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-tall-is-tobey-maguire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How tall is Tobey Maguire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
