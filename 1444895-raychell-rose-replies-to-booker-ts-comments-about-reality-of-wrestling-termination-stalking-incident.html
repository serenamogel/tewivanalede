Reed was one of the top talents in the school, and he was accused of stalking her.</p><p><a href=#>Fightful</a> was the first to report the details about Raychell Rose and her stalker incident.</p><p>Recently, on his <a href=#>Hall of Fame</a> podcast, Booker T <a href=#>opened up</a> about the incident and shared his knowledge of the situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Following his comments, Raychell Rose has posted a video on her <a href=#>YouTube channel</a> speaking about everything that had and has been happening with regards to her and Reality Of Wrestling.</p><p>“I know there has been some confusion regarding statements or claims that were made after the Fightful article came out that detailed my stalking situation. As well as my departure from Reality Of Wrestling. And any kind of confusion regarding those statements in the article or the events, more importantly, that occurred during my stalking situation… Is harmful to any kind of legal process I have going on to try and get protection from my stalker. So, I am going to clear that up as best I can. As far as the way things are handled at Reality Of Wrestling with people saying I didn’t go to Booker enough or I didn’t call Booker directly… Or I should have done more on my end to stop what happened from happening…</p><h2 id=h-raychell-rose-that-s-just-not-the-way-things-were-handled>Raychell Rose: That’s just not the way things were handled</h2><p>“That’s just not the way things were handled at Reality Of Wrestling in my experience. In my experience you went to Kevin with the day-to-day operations. Because he ran Day-to-Day Operations. So you dealt with Kevin Bernhardt directly. And then if he told you, ‘You need to escalate things to talking with Booker or Sharmell about things,’ then that’s when you would do that. And I was never told by Kevin I needed to talk to Booker and Sharmell and I was also directly told not to do that. Because he had informed me that he kept them informed throughout the entire situation. I, throughout the entire situation was on the phone with police, lawyers, and District Attorneys. And after every single one of those phone calls or interactions I called or talked to Kevin Bernhardt personally in person.</p><h2>Why didn’t Raychell Rose talk to Booker T directly?</h2><p>“And he told me each time when I asked if I needed to go to Booker that he had already talked to Booker or he was going to talk to Booker for me. So that I didn’t have to worry myself about it. And I had no reason to believe otherwise after being told that by Kevin Bernhardt. Secondly, as far as any kind of trespass warrant for my stalker. I did get on the phone with Texas City Police Department today. It’s February 13th, 2024. And I did ask them for a copy of that record. Because it would aid me in getting a restraining order or any other kind of legal process to move forward if I had that documentation.&nbsp;</p><h2>What happened when Raychell Rose wanted a copy of the Trespass Warning?</h2><p>“So I did request a copy of it. And they told me that there is no documentation or any other kind of record in their database. For Shawn Reed as far as trespass warnings go… That he’s never been issued a Trespass warning in general for that premises or any other… They said that he was handled at that premises before. But there was no trespass warning requested or issued associated with that event or any others for Shawn Reed. So there… Any claims that there is a trespass warrant or warning, it’s not a legal trespass warning if… Whatever they’re referring to. As far as those claims and it’s not something that can be upheld by the police. And it’s not something, unfortunately, that can aid me in getting any kind of legal aid for my situation.</p><h2>Raychell Rose clears the air with regards to claims about her purposefully being present at the bar that Shawn Reed was in</h2><p>“Also there has been claims that I knew Shawn Reed was at the bar when I decided to go to the bar next door to Reality Of Wrestling, Stut Garden. That is not the case. I was not informed by Booker T or anyone else that Shawn Reed was at that bar, I wasn’t informed by Booker T or Kevin Bernhardt that Shawn Reed was in the building. And was present for the entire wrestling show that night.</p><p>“I found out that Shawn Reed was present for the first time when I went to the same bar that I always go to after Reality Of Wrestling shows. I was in my usual place. And that is when I first saw Shawn Reed that night. I wasn’t going anywhere I wasn’t supposed to be. I wasn’t going anywhere that I didn’t usually go. And I certainly did not go into that bar looking for Shawn Reed, knowing Shawn Reed was there or attempting to contact Shawn Reed. He came to that bar knowing I was there and coming to my usual place in order to confront and see me.&nbsp;</p><h2>Raychell Rose elaborates on what was the conversation she had with Booker T</h2><p>“And… There has been comments about a conversation that I had with Booker outside of the Reality Of Wrestling venue. And that conversation pertained to me calling the police. It was when I was calling the police and I was urged to go home by Booker T. I was urged… His solution from what I understood, it was for me to go home and not involve the police. And that was his solution to help things go away or make it… My stalking situation go away.</p><p>“I did not disobey Booker in that order. I did what I had to do to obey the police. When they told me the first time I made a police report that I had to call them immediately every time Shawn Reed showed up. So, I was obeying police orders when I called the police and let them know that my stalker was here. And when I followed their dispatcher’s direction to look inside the venue to see if my stalker was still inside the venue. I did not do that to disobey Booker, I did that to obey the police instruction for my safety and to help me in my legal process.&nbsp;</p><h2>Raychell Rose is still dealing with the issue on a day-to-day basis</h2><p>“There have been comments about why this article took so long to come out. Why I took so long to speak on the matter publicly? And it was about a year from the December incident that this article came out. A little over a year and that seems like a long time for people who are removed from the situation. Reality Of Wrestling and anyone associated with it is removed from the situation.</p><p>“They have not made themselves available to me. To aid in my legal matters. So I don’t believe they’ve been involved or have put much thought into these situations since that night.</p><p>“I on the other hand, have been dealing with this on a day-to-day basis throughout this entire year. I still regularly contact police, I still regularly contact lawyers, and I still regularly deal with my stalking situation. So it is not been far removed from me. This is something I’m actively dealing with and this is just another process of me actively dealing with this situation that has been the same for me for yeas at this point. This situation did not go away for me. It’s something that I continue to deal with and this was part of the process of dealing with this situation.”</p><h2>Raychell Rose on how she was fired</h2><p>“There have been comments that have mentioned the fact that the words ‘You’re fired’ were not said to me. Those words were not said to me. What I recall being said to me is that they didn’t want a crazy person at their school and that they didn’t want police involvement. And I recall telling them, ‘The only way to try and keep my stalker away from their school without police involvement is to keep me away from their school. I recall being told, ‘If that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes.’ And I also recall being told that my issue is that I don’t take any responsibility for my actions or accountability. And that they did not need something or someone like that in their locker room,” Raychell Rose said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>We at Wrestlezone are glad that Rose is safe and hope the matter gets sorted soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNta3FxZWK%2FosXCoZylpF2nvLSxjKucqaSZmsBuwM5mmainm5q%2FbsDSZpqopZ2au7W%2FjJqZqK2kYr%2Bmrcuiq7Jln5t6uL7ErKuloZ6cerWx0aagp5mknryvedKtmKWjmaO0brXNnKCdnZ6p</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sadie-mauro-obituary-and-cause-of-death-what-happened-to-sadie-mauro.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sadie Mauro Obituary And Cause Of Death: What Happened To Sadie Mauro?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./facts-about-molly-vevers-age-and-career-as-heather-in-the-rig-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Facts About Molly Vevers Age And Career As Heather In The Rig</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
