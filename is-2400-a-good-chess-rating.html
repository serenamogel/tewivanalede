To become a grandmaster, a player must achieve both of the following: An Elo rating of at least 2500 at any point in their career (although they need not maintain this level to obtain or keep the title).<h2>Is 2700 a good chess rating?</h2>This is the list of top ranked chess grandmasters, ordered by their peak Elo rating. The cut-off value is 2700. Notably only six players achieved their over-2700 peak before the year 2000 and twenty-one players achieved their respective peak between the years 2000 and 2009 (inclusive).<h2>How good is a Class D chess player?</h2>Class D [1200-1399]- same as class e but doesnt fall for simple tactics and doesnt drop pieces any more but opening,middle, and endgame knowledge is poor.

If there are more idiots joining FIDE in the coming years, Carlsen as well as others may reach the 3000 mark.
