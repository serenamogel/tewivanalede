We’ve already tackled the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/dollar-tree-drinks/>best drinks to buy at Dollar Tree</a>, the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/dollar-tree-canned-food-haul/>best canned food to buy at Dollar Tree</a>, and the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/healthy-dollar-tree-snacks/>best healthy snacks to buy at Dollar Tree</a>. Now we’re here to address what is arguably the best section at Dollar Tree: the frozen food aisle. We recently stopped into our local D Tree to scour their freezer for fun finds that should wind up in your freezer at home. Add them to your Dollar Tree grocery list the next time you go on a budget shopping trip. You’ll be glad you did! Here are six of the best frozen foods to buy at Dollar Tree right now.</p><strong><a href=#>White Castle Classic Cheese Sliders</a></strong><p>We’re starting off strong. Too strong, maybe. But I’m okay with it all going downhill from here if that means I get to talk about how much I love White Castle’s frozen sliders, which I was pretty pumped to spot in the frozen food section at my local Dollar Tree. These things are perfection. As Sporked’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/author/gwyneddstuart/>Gwynedd Stuart</a> put it in ranking of White Castle’s frozen offerings, White Castle burgers taste great with onions alone, but a slice of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-american-cheese/>American chees</a>e really amps up their salty, pleasing flavor. It’s creamy and melty and melds so well with the iconic flavor of a White Castle burger patty.” Gwynedd said she’d have these in her freezer 24/7, and thanks to Dollar Tree, you can, too!</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-white-castle-frozen-snacks/>best White Castle frozen sliders (and more)</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Eggo Cinnamon French Toaster Sticks</a></strong><p>I’m sorry to every home cook, but your homemade french toast just isn’t worth the effort when frozen french toast sticks are this easy to make. Maybe it’s the satisfaction of eating with your hands and dunking a stick into a big cup of syrup. Or it could be that these particular frozen french toast sticks stay unsogged because you heat them up in the toaster. Whatever Eggo is doing when they making these things, they need to keep it up. If you’re ready to admit defeat and get a box of the good stuff, Dollar Tree has Eggo’s “toaster sticks” for just three bucks. Add these to your list of frozen foods to buy at Dollar Tree if you have a tendency to skip breakfast unless you can heat up something very quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-eggo-waffles/> best Eggo waffles</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Snapps Loaded Potato Sticks</a></strong><p>Our local Dollar Tree had a few of these Snapps apps: <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-mozzarella-sticks/>mozzarella sticks</a>, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-mac-and-cheese-bites/>mac and cheese bites</a>, potato skins, and these potato sticks. These looked like the most fun by virtue of being the weirdest. Each one is like a tube-shaped, deep-fried, loaded baked potato. You get potato, sour cream, cheddar cheese, bacon, and chives, all in a “crispy, golden coating.” Your family will think they’re about to bite into a regular ol’ mozzarella stick and then—bam!—baked potato city. A box of these will set you back $1.25 at Dollar Tree, so you kind of can’t afford not to buy them, am I right?</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Bibigo <strong></strong></a><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Mandu </a></strong>Bulgogi Chicken Dumplings</strong><p>I love ordering delivery. My wallet, however, does not love it. That’s why I like to find ways to compromise, like having frozen dumplings in the freezer at all times. This way I can order an entree (and maybe a side of fried rice if I’m feeling splurge-y), but skip an order of dumplings because I already got ‘em. And as Sporked‘s many <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-dumplings/>dumpling taste tests</a> have demonstrated, Bibigo dumplings are good, so I don’t have to feel like I’m cheating myself out of a good time.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-dumplings/>best frozen dumplings</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Banquet Chicken Fried Beef Steak Mega Bowls</a></strong><p>That’s right! You can get full meals in the frozen section at Dollar Tree. Maybe you just don’t feel like cooking dinner. Or you need something filling for lunch at work. Either way, this Banquet bowl will do the trick. My local Dollar Tree actually had a few Banquet options to choose from, but this one looked like the most filling. Mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, and cheese to go with your beef fritters? Yes please!</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Twix Cookies & Creme Ice Cream Bar</a></strong><p>We can’t leave Dollar Tree’s frozen section without dessert! This place is serious about its ice cream game. There are a ton of options here: new <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-ben-jerrys-flavors/>Ben & Jerry’s flavors</a>, ice cream you haven’t seen since your childhood, gelato and Italian ice—you name it, they’ve got it. I am a cookies & cream stan to my core, so I’m recommending these Twix Cookies & Creme ice cream bars. I’d never seen these before, but I love that they’re a twist on a nostalgic favorite. And this is Dollar Tree! Everything’s cheap! Try something new!</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-cookies-and-cream-ice-cream/>best cookies and cream ice cream</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Aldi Fall Finds! | Sporked" title='Play video "Aldi Fall Finds! | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3aegAv9xOg&list=PLHbjKrchTZztv-7UOi8GKRze15cUvRGmp</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFusM6lo5qqXam%2FprGMn6mospWjeqe7zp2qaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-solve-herodiana-puzzle-3-in-hogwarts-legacy-solve-herodiana-puzzle-in-hogwarts-legacy-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How To Solve Herodiana Puzzle 3 In Hogwarts Legacy?
