And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed.Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed.
It's a heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's a dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.</description></item><item><title>How wide is a billy bookcase</title><link>/how-wide-is-a-billy-bookcase.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-wide-is-a-billy-bookcase.html</guid><description>Table of Contents
