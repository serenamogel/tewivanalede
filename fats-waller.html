Johnson. He proved a gifted piano player and songwriter, delivering such jazz standards as "Ain't Misbehavin'." In the 1930s, Waller's fame reached new heights following his performances on radio and in film. He died from bronchial pneumonia on December 15, 1943, in Kansas City, Missouri.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thomas Wright "Fats" Waller was born on May 21, 1904, in New York City. He learned to play piano at the age of 6, and within a few years was also learning the reed organ, string bass and violin. After dropping out of school at around age 15, he became an organist at the Lincoln Theatre in Harlem.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller's father, Edward, a baptist minister, was hopeful that his son would follow a religious calling instead of a career in jazz. However, the path to music became inevitable following the death of Waller's mother, Adeline, in 1920. Waller moved in with the family of pianist Russell B.T. Brooks, who introduced the youngster to James P. Johnson, founder of the stride school of jazz piano.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rise to Popularity</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller made his recording debut in 1922 for Okeh Records with the solo efforts "Muscle Shoals Blues" and "Binningham Blues." Shortly afterward, he released "Squeeze Me," an important early work that established his bona fides as a songwriter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller continued to play organ at the Lincoln Theatre while also taking engagements at theaters in Philadelphia and Chicago. In addition, he often starred at Harlem's famous "rent parties," where he and his fellow musicians would essentially stage concerts in friends' homes. Larger than life with his sheer size and magnetic personality, Waller was known to enjoy alcohol and female attention in abundance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller became more involved with writing and performing for revues in the late 1920s, starting with Keep Shufflin' in 1927. He forged a strong collaborative partnership with Andy Razaf, with whom he wrote two of his most famous stage songs, "Honeysuckle Rose" and "Ain't Misbehavin'." During this time, Waller also recorded such standards as "Handful of Keys" and "Valentine Stomp" as a soloist, and "The Minor Drag" and "Harlem Fuss" as leader of Fats Waller and His Buddies.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Radio and Film</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller branched out to radio with his New York-based shows "Paramount on Parade" and "Radio Roundup" from 1930-31, and the Cincinnati-based "Fats Waller's Rhythm Club" from 1932-34. After returning to New York in 1934, he began a new regular radio program, "Rhythm Club," and formed the Fats Waller and His Rhythm sextet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller appeared in two Hollywood films in 1935, Hooray for Love! and King of Burlesque. However, while his fame was spreading, he reportedly had become disenchanted with the comedic, irreverent persona that fans had come to expect from his broadcasts, instead seeking more respect as a serious artist. He appeared to be making strong strides in that direction after a trip to England in 1938, recording the ambitious composition "London Suite."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Late Career and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller returned to Hollywood early in 1943 to film Stormy Weather with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/lena-horne data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lena Horne" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lena Horne</a> and Bill Robinson. After returning to New York, he began writing songs for another revue, Early to Bed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Waller had maintained a heavy travel schedule into the 1940s, despite declining health, but the wear and tear eventually caught up with him. While returning home from another West Coast trip in late 1943, he contracted bronchial pneumonia, an illness that silenced the beloved and influential jazz great for good during a stop in Kansas City, Missouri, on December 15, 1943.</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Fats Waller</li><li>Birth Year: 1904</li><li>Birth date: May 21, 1904</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: New York</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: African American pianist Fats Waller wrote such jazz standards as "Ain't Misbehavin'" and earned fame for his comedic radio performances in the 1930s.</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Gemini</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>According to one colorful story, Fats Waller was kidnapped at gunpoint by Al Capone's henchmen and forced to perform at a birthday party for the mob boss.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1943</li><li>Death date: December 15, 1943</li><li>Death State: Missouri</li><li>Death City: Kansas City</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=27><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Fats Waller Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musicians/fats-waller</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 7, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=32 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>One never knows, do one?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJonZqso2LEorjLnqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-legend-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Legend Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chills-net-worth-329322.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chills Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
