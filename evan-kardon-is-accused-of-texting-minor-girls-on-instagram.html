After it was discovered that the well-known powerlifter had reportedly sent inappropriate texts to underage females, the powerlifting and training community on GymTok banded together to have him removed from the platform.</p><h2>Who is Evan Kardon, exactly?</h2><p>American bodybuilder and powerlifter Evan Kardon has over 750k followers on his TikTok fitness account under the handle @enterkardon. With the help of his 20,000 Instagram followers, he shares related content. He also provides details about his wife and children.</p><p>On September 26, 1994, Kardon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. The 28-year-old TikTok celebrity participated in baseball, tennis, basketball, cross-country running, and other sports in high school before turning to uplifting. He is renowned for his huge build and challenging lifts.</p><p>Evan is a vegan powerlifter who rejects the consumption of meat and other animal products. He even recommends smoothies with plant-derived protein and a diet that is entirely plant-based.</p><p>He said in multiple interviews that the powerlifting scene and GymTok don’t like him because of his laid-back demeanor. His big following was a result of his claim that he wasn’t afraid to say what was on his mind.</p><p>Despite not competing professionally since 2019, Evan’s deadlift videos won him popularity on social media. He is also known for sharing exercise videos of other fitness stars finishing them, then immediately following with one of his own, completely crushing them.</p><p>In November 2021, he posted his first TikTok video, which included him deadlifting 705 pounds. As of 2022, he can deadlift 855 pounds.</p><p>On October 5, 2022, Mr. Goob @mrgoobreturns, a TikTok user, posted a video detailing how he discovered Kardon was messaging girls who were 16 and under.</p><p>Arlind (Arlindthezerg on Instagram), a different powerlifter who frequently does this kind of expose on his YouTube channel, created a false account. The fake account presented a lengthy page of a girl who claimed to be sixteen years old but was still enrolled in high school.</p><p>Mr. Goob then shows a string of texts in which the influencer communicates with the bogus account after mistaking it for a kid. He insisted on starting a conversation with her despite being aware of her age. He also invited her to his residence, his hometown in North Carolina.</p><p>To remove the powerlifter’s account, which is currently restricted and only has about 700 followers as of right now, other GymTok users have banded together. In his lone video, two young women are seen deadlifting manageable weights. He then displays his own 800-pound deficit deadlift and says, “Tag @tiktok to get them to unban me.”</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
