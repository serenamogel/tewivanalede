He also helped launched the streaming platform, BET Plus, as a joint venture between BET and Tyler Perry Studios in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Collage-Maker-17-Feb-2023-03.42-PM-600x338.jpg><p>During an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” on April 4, the 53-year-old actor and playwright confirmed the rumors were true, told journalist Nischelle Turner that he plans to acquire Paramount’s majority stake if presented with the opportunity.</p><p>Turner caught up with the director on the set of his upcoming film, “Six Triple Eight,” at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Perry Studios</a>.</p><p>“Rumor? No, it’s not a rumor,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> Perry. “I’ve been there for four years now and had tremendous success. I wasn’t expecting this to happen, so, yes — if that is possible, I’m very, very interested in taking as much of it as I can.</p><p>He said, “If it’s possible, I’m gonna take as much of it as I can.”</p><p>Perry currently has several shows airing on BET, the same network that helped to fund his first major movie back in 2005, “Diary of a Mad Black Woman.” The philanthropist also told Turner that he liked the idea of so many other Black entrepreneurs being in a position to consider buying BET.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean “Diddy” Combs</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Byron Allen</a> are also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> interested in buying a stake in the network. Perry added that it was important for the network to be Black-owned again.</p><p>“Part of it is — and I’ve read about Byron Allen and Puffy and everybody wanting&nbsp;to bid and so on and so forth, and I think it’s really great because when, this is what I love about it, when Bob Johnson sold it in 2000, I think it was, there wasn’t one Black person who could buy it,” Perry explained.</p><p>“So now, to see all of these Black people, men and women, who are able to be in a position to buy it? Man, that makes me feel really, really excited.”</p><p>Johnson founded BET&nbsp;in 1979 with his wife Sheila and later sold the company to Viacom.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyler Perry confirms that he intends to buy BET Media Group, which is currently owned by Paramount. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OiCqGVYZW9</a></p>— Entertainment Tonight (@etnow) <a href=#>April 4, 2023</a></figure><p>Perry went on the credit Viacom and Paramount for nurturing the network but added that there was sadness in the community when BET was not under Black’s ownership.</p><p>“I think there was sadness when Bob sold it, and I think there’ll be happiness when it’s Black-owned again,” he continued.</p><p>“And even though Shari (Redstone) and what is it? Viacom and Paramount? They’ve done a phenomenal job with it. They didn’t let it fall by the wayside;&nbsp;they didn’t let it go into dust. They nurtured it and took care of it.”</p><p>He said, “And to see Shari at this position saying, ‘I think it should be returned to a Black owner?’ I figured, OK, see, that’s my kind of person.'”</p><p>Perry teased Turner after she asked about the timeline of his potential purchase and said that the matter could be resolved in 22 years.</p><p>“We can very much say that there are conversations, I am beyond interested, and there will be a resolution in … 22 years,” he joked.</p><p>Fans reacted to the news on social media.</p><p>“Black <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">excellence</a>.”</p><p>“Tyler Perry bout to buy BET hope he stay safe out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.”</p><p>“Nah, I am not ready for <strong>BET</strong> to become <strong>Tyler Perry</strong> Networks. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lol</a>.”</p><p>Perry is currently a minority stakeholder in the company along with ‘Black-ish” creator Kenya Barris and others. His shows “House of Payne,” “Oval,” “Sistas,” and “Assisted Living,” are currently airing on BET.</p><p>“All the Queen’s Men” is currently available on BET Plus, the network that’s also home to his popular “Madea” film series, “Daddy’s Little Girls,” and others.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49tZmltX57BtHnNqKtmmV2nwq670WarsqSVp3qxsdGrsGabn6Ozqr7MrGShnV2srq%2FA0marqGWSqsZursStZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./this-is-us-alum-justin-hartley-and-sofia-pernas-are-married-know-their-wedding-ceremony.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is US Alum Justin Hartley and Sofia Pernas Are Married: Know Their Wedding Ceremony</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rosie-mcclelland.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rosie McClelland</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
