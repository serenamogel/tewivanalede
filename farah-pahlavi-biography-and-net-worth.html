She was given the name Farah Diba. She was the daughter of Captain Sohrab Diba and his wife, Farideh Ghotbi, and was raised in a wealthy family. Her father was a graduate of the French Military Academy of St. Cyr and served as an officer in the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces. Pahlavi was very close to her father, and when he passed away in 1948 when she was ten years old, it had a significant impact on her. After his passing, the family was compelled to leave their spacious mansion in northern Tehran and move into a joint flat with another relative.</p><p>Pahlavi started her schooling at the Italian School in Tehran. After that, she attended the French Jeanne d’Arc School until she was 16 years old, at which point she transferred to the Lycée Razi. She was an active young woman who rose to the position of basketball team captain at her school. She followed her passion for architecture at the Ecole Spéciale d’Architecture in Paris after completing her secondary education, studying under Albert Besson.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Farah Pahlavi – فرح پهلوی (@shahbanou_farah_pahlavi)</a></p><h2>Career</h2><p>After her 1959 marriage to the Iranian Shah, Pahlavi’s career in the public spotlight officially began. At first, it wasn’t apparent what her function would be beyond giving birth to a male heir for the Shah. However, she was free to focus on more formal governmental activities after giving birth to a son successfully in 1960. She initially restricted herself to a largely ceremonial position. The exchange of cultural items between French and Iranian art galleries and museums was made possible because of her friendship with André Malraux, the French minister of culture. Up to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, this commerce persisted. She also devoted a lot of her time to attending numerous healthcare and educational institutions’ opening ceremonies.</p><h2 id=empress-iran><strong>Empress of Iran</strong></h2><p>When Farah Pahlavi married Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, her reign as empress officially began in 1959. By sponsoring organizations like the Iran-American Society, the Iran National Commission for UNESCO, and the Farah Pahlavi Foundation, which prioritized education and public health, she utilized her position to push for women’s rights, education, and cultural preservation.</p><p>She rose to become one of the most well-known individuals in the Imperial Government and the benefactor of 24 various institutions of learning, healthcare, and culture. She also had a key role in promoting the creation of an active art scene in Iran and bringing attention to the local art that already existed.</p><p>However, as the 1970s wore on, a growing sense of discontent among the populace sparked anti-monarchy protests. The Shah and Pahlavi departed Iran in January 1979 after the nation experienced violent riots. After that, they visited Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, and Morocco. When the Shah passed away in 1980 due to sickness, Pahlavi went back into exile in Egypt for over two years. In response to a 1982 invitation from President Ronald Reagan, she later relocated to the country.</p><h2>Honors;</h2><h3><span id=National class=mw-headline>National</span></h3><ul><li><a title="Order of the Pleiades (Iran)" href=#>Order of the Pleiades, 1st Class</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Foreign class=mw-headline>Foreign</span></h3><ul><li>Austria: Grand Star of the&nbsp;Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria</li><li>Czechoslovakia: Grand Cross of the&nbsp;<a title="Order of the White Lion" href=#>Order of the White Lion</a></li><li><span class=flagicon>&nbsp;</span>Denmark: Knight of the&nbsp;Order of the Elephant</li><li>Italy: Grand Cross with Collar of the&nbsp;<a title="Order of Merit of the Italian Republic" href=#>Order of Merit of the Italian Republic</a></li><li>Norway: Dame Grand Cross of the&nbsp;Order of Saint Olav</li><li>Spain: Dame Grand Cross of the&nbsp;Order of Isabella the Catholic</li><li><span class=flagicon>&nbsp;</span>Thailand: Dame Grand Cordon with Chain of the&nbsp;Order of the Royal House of Chakri</li></ul><h3><span id=Awards class=mw-headline>Awards</span></h3><ul><li><span class=flagicon>&nbsp;</span>Austria: Look!

During the Shah’s formal visit to Paris on behalf of Iran, they crossed paths. They started dating after she returned to Tehran in the summer of 1959, and in November of the same year, they made their engagement public. She wore the freshly commissioned Noor-ol-Ain Diamond tiara and a bridal gown by Yves Saint Laurent. It was clear that Pahlavi was under pressure to have a male heir after their marriage. Even though her spouse had already been married twice, neither union had resulted in a male heir. The following four children were born to the couple: a son in 1969, and three daughters in 1963, 1966, and 1970.</p><p>“An Enduring Love: My Life with the Shah,” a book by Pahlavi, was published in 2003. In Europe, it rose to the top-seller list. The Queen and I,” a feature-length documentary on Pahlavi’s life, was released in 2009 by the Swedish-Persian director Nahid Persson Sarvestani. It was shown at several international film festivals, including Sundance and IDFA.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Who is Farah Pahlavi?</h3><p>Farah Pahlavi is an Iranian Empress</p><h3 id=what-farah-pahlavi8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Farah Pahlavi’s net worth?</strong></h3><p>Farah Pahlavi is an Iranian Empress who has a net worth of $200 million.</p><h3>How old is Farah Pahlavi?</h3><p>84 years old</p><h2>More Articles on RNN</h2><p><a href=#>Victor Oladipo Biography And Net Worth</a></p><p><a href=#>Justin Trudeau Biography And Net Worth</a></p><p><a href=#>Bud Adams Biography and Net Worth</a></p><p><a href=#>Jean Bertrand Aristide Biography And Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOn5irmZhivaK0y5qtomWSnryovsCpn7JlkaOxbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tart-cherry-tabbouleh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tart Cherry Tabbouleh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./haley-tju.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Haley Tju</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
