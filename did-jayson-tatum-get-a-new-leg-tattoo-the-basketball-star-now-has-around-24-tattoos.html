The eagle-eyed fans of the athlete noticed that he had new artwork on his left calf. He never hesitated to make his body a canvas.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The new tattoo looks big and bold. Similar to some of his other designs in his body, it is also a letter readable from a distance. The art says, “I Just Didn’t Quit.” He also has a small checkered flag below it and the phrase “Hustle Man.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has inked the number 94 on his left knee. Most of his tattoos are on his left leg compared to the right one. He has also written the number 24. Another artwork he has is of two jerseys, among which one has Duke written to it with the number zero. Similarly, another has Chaminade over it with the number 22.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also, on his right thigh, he has an image of a vast cloud formed after a bomb explosion. Surrounding the picture is text, “St. Louis til the world blows.” We believe he has his values, and whatever art he has over his body means for him and is priceless.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Do Not Miss:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jayson Tatum Reveals His Mom Brandy Cole Is A Tough Critic, Further Details On The Basketball Player’s Family</span></p><h2 id=learn-about-jayson-tatums-back-tattoo><span class=ez-toc-section id=learn-about-jayson-tatums-back-tattoo></span>Learn About Jayson Tatum’s Back Tattoo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jayson seems to have added something to his back torso as well. Before, he had written God’s Will in big, bold letters.

City, which means universal city. There is also an image of a small house on his back.

Almost every ink he has in his body seems to carry a meaning to the athlete’s life. Thus, he has many tattoos on his body so far.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, his fans always look forward to him talking about his tats. They also wanted to know what inspired him to get his recent ink work. Some of the tattoos he had on his body are of a mother, and a kid, which we believe are him and his mom.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, another realistic photo is inked on his body where a man is holding a kid. Below that art, there is a text like father, like son.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqrrdispqdlpJbBtrmMoJytZZFiu6bDjKWcoGWklsG1u85mq6GdXZeutLfErZmapJxiwLWt0WalqK9dna60ecCrpq6mlGJ%2FdXnTmqutp5%2BofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rockin-rebel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rockin Rebel - Wrestlezone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./addie-mae-collins.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Addie Mae Collins - Murder, Alabama &amp;amp; Death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
