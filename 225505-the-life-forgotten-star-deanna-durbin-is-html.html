One author is telling her story.</p><p class=Zg>In his new book, "Deanna Durbin A Hollywood Fairy Tale - The Legend of Edna Mae," William Harper details the life of a long-forgotten Hollywood star.</p><p class=Zg>Born <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002052/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">in Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, Canada, on December 4, 1921, Durbin's given name was Edna Durbin. As a young girl, Durbin traveled to California with her British-born parents.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>HER PATH TO STARDOM</strong></p><p class=Zg>Durbin could sing, act, and dance. As a child, she took voice lessons. By the time she was a young teenager, she had signed on with MGM and was a hit on the series short, "Every Sunday," alongside Judy Garland.</p><p class=Zg>Her run with MGM didn't last. However, Universal Pictures saw an opportunity and quickly contracted with the young girl. Durbin's stardom blew up with the 1936 film, "Three Smart Girls."</p><p class=Zg>The movie, along with its sequel, "One Hundred Men and a Girl," was credited with saving Universal from bankruptcy. Its success landed Durbin follow-up roles in 1938's "That Certain Age" and "Mad About Music."</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>A LACK OF RECOGNITION</strong></p><p class=Zg>Another installment, titled "Three Smart Girls Grow Up," earned Durbin the Juvenile Award from the Academy. 1943 saw the final installment, "Hers to Hold."</p><p class=Zg>Durbin's fame was no small matter. She had dolls and dresses made after her, and her first on-screen kiss made headline news. Yet the whole thing was just not suited to her personality. She left Hollywood in her early 20s.</p><p class=Zg>Harper <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/1930s-star-deanna-durbin-old-hollywood>said</a> of her success: "You would think that maybe in the '60s or '70s, she could have received a lifetime achievement award or something for her work. People remembered her, but they just didn't talk about her anymore."</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>CHOOSING SOLIDARITY OVER FAME</strong></p><p class=Zg>The writer adorned praise on Harper for instilling hope through her work on the silver screen. However, he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/1930s-star-deanna-durbin-old-hollywood>notes </a>that she became "displeased" with the entertainment industry for lack of involvement in her own career.</p><p class=Zg>Durbin had been effectively typecast as the good girl and wanted to be able to choose different roles. Additionally, she was no fan of interviews and other promotional elements the job called for.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>PERSONAL LIFE AND DEATH</strong></p><p class=Zg>In her personal life, Durbin got married three times. The first time was at age 19 in 1941 to director Vaughn Paul. They divorced after two years. Durbin married again in 1945 to producer Felix Jackson.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Deanna Durbin poses with a flowered blouse and pink skirt in circa 1955 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>They had a daughter before splitting in 1949. That same year, Durbin moved to France to a village near Paris. In 1950, she married French director Charles Davis, who was 16 years her senior.</p><p class=Zg>The two stayed together until Davis' death <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/01/deanna-durbin>in 1991</a>. They shared a son during their union. In 2013, Durbin passed away at the age of 91 after living a life of privacy for most of her years.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>MCKENZIE WESTMORE, CHILD STAR</strong></p><p class=Zg>Another child star the world came to know and love was McKenzie Westmore. At <a class="zd d" href=#>just three</a>, Westmore was active in Hollywood thanks, in part, to her famous makeup artist father, Michael.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>McKenzie Westmore during her wedding ceremony at the Chateau Le Dome, Saddlerock Ranch Winery on October 11, 2015 in Malibu, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Westmore is best known for her role in the hit soap opera, "Passions." She was on the show for nine years and earned two Daytime Emmy nominations. Today, Westmore is 43 years old and married to French actor Patrick Tatopoulos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtpbm1ganq1tMRmo6KelWKzsL7GqKutnZ5iwLWt0Wabnpmeo65usNSrmaKmXZ7Ab7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-bennetts-son-danny-helped-him-find-freedom-before-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Bennett's Son Danny Helped Him Find Freedom' Before Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sonic-hard-seltzer-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Our Honest Sonic Hard Seltzer Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
