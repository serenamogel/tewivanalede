If you happen to be cooking for a special occasion (maybe Easter or Mother’s Day brunch?), egg recipes can come in handy then too.

I don’t know about you, but when the weather warms up, my dessert cravings shift away from chocolate towards lighter, brighter treats. This change works out well for me, because carrot cake is Jack’s all-time favorite dessert, and we make it every year for his April birthday. You’ll find our go-to healthy carrot cake recipe below. It’s based on my mom’s, and it uses her secret ingredient: applesauce. It steps in for some of the oil and sugar that you’d find in a traditional carrot cake recipe without compromising on taste. This healthy carrot cake is…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I don’t have a stockpile of healthy snacks on hand, I will, without fail, reach for a cookie at 3pm. Now, there’s nothing wrong with treating yourself to something sweet in the afternoon, but if I’m working on a new&nbsp;cookie recipe, there’s a good chance that snacking on sweets will become less of a treat and more of a habit. Over the years, I’ve learned that filling up on healthy snacks like veggies and dip, smoothies, or trail mix will only make those sweets more rewarding in the end. I’ll be more energized and focused throughout the day, my…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This post is in partnership with&nbsp;Lundberg Family Farms. Happy Friday! Is anyone else SO excited that it’s finally spring? Here in Chicago, the temperatures are gradually getting warmer, and I’m in the mood for all things fresh and bright. I’m making smoothies for breakfast, salads for lunch, and these veggie-topped puffed grain cakes for an afternoon snack. In case you’re looking for some new spring snack ideas, I’m sharing the recipe for these yummy puffed grain cakes below. To make them, I spread a creamy, herby white bean spread on Lundberg Organic Brown Rice Thin Stackers. Then, I top them…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love the moment when I first slice into a watermelon radish. From the outside, this root veggie looks so humble, its skin grubby and pale green. But when I cut into it, I reveal a radiant pink interior. On a gray day in late winter or early spring, nothing makes me happier than bold, bright color like that. So at this time of year, watermelon radishes are a staple in my kitchen. But apparently, not everyone cooks with them as often as I do. In fact, each time I share a new watermelon radish recipe, I hear from readers…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>On a weekend morning, I love starting my day with a stack of healthy pancakes. Pancakes, because it’s the weekend. And healthy (or healthy-ish), because they leave me feeling satisfied, energized, and ready to take on the day. You’ll find my go-to healthy pancake recipes in the post below. Some showcase fresh fruit, others call for whole grain flour, and still others are made without grains at all. They’re all similar in that they rely on simple, wholesome ingredients, they’re easy to mix together, and they’re absolutely delicious. If you’re looking for a fun way to kick off the morning,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Did you catch Tuesday’s post? It was all about Swiss chard, one of my favorite leafy greens. After going on and on about how much I love working with this versatile veggie (and why you should love it too!), I thought I owed you another Swiss chard recipe. So here you are! This lemony Swiss chard pasta is what weeknight dreams are made of. It calls for a short list of pantry ingredients, and it comes together in right around 30 minutes. Still, it’s filled with a delicious mix of textures and flavors. Sautéed chard stems add crunch, while the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We all go crazy over spinach and kale, but when was the last time you cooked Swiss chard? This vibrant leafy green is one of my favorite vegetables to work with. It’s endlessly versatile – my go-to Swiss chard recipes range from smoky Mojo bowls to a lemony pasta – and its stems are just as edible as its dark green leaves. Because I think we could all be cooking it more often, I wanted to share a little Swiss chard 101 today. If you’ve never worked with chard before, I hope these tips and recipes will encourage you to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These chocolate chip cookie bars are the kind of super simple, super delicious treat that we could all use more of in our lives. They have perfect puffy tops, lightly crisp edges, and soft, chewy middles that are packed with chocolate chips. They’re sweet, but not too sweet, and brown sugar and vanilla fill them with rich, warm depth of flavor. Though they’re not necessarily faster than regular cookies (make sure to give them time to cool before you slice them!), they are definitely easier. Instead of scooping the dough or rolling it into balls, all you have to do…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I make this mushroom polenta recipe when I’m craving something comforting, but still light and fresh. For that reason, I think it’s perfect for this time of year. I don’t know about you, but I’m more than ready for spring. Warm weather, sun, trips to the farmers market, and picnics in the park… Sadly, Chicago weather is&nbsp;not quite&nbsp;there yet. So for the next few weeks, while it’s still chilly and we still have the occasional snow, this mushroom polenta recipe will continue to hit the spot. It starts with a base of creamy polenta. Then, I layer on sautéed mushrooms.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Everyone raves about Italian pasta and pizza, but if you ask me, polenta deserves just as much love. A north Italian porridge made of coarsely ground cornmeal, polenta is wonderfully creamy, with a lightly sweet, buttery corn flavor. Unlike oat porridge, it’s not a traditional breakfast food. Though I do eat it for breakfast on occasion (see page 49 of Love and Lemons Every Day!), I most often enjoy this smooth, savory porridge for dinner. Topped with cheese, herbs, cooked vegetables, or a flavorful sauce, it transforms into a mouthwatering comfort food.
