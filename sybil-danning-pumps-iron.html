Or, as Dacy would put it, even more famous. Dacy is the kind of guy who leaves telephone messages to tell you that he will be calling you next week with news about Sybil Danning.</p><p>As for Sybil Danning, you know all about her from her famous cover of Playboy, in which she posed in the leather harness, and from her celebrated feud with her co-star in "<a href=#>Hercules</a>," <a href=#>Lou Ferrigno</a>, who let the other gladiators take off their cloaks, but made Sybil keep hers on, for fear she would upstage his muscles. And that was before Sybil had muscles of her own, which she certainly does now.</p><p>"Look at this," said Dacy, unrolling a poster of Sybil wearing a camouflage bikini and carrying a machinegun, her muscular calves astride the jungle.</p><p>"Sybil, you've been pumping iron," I said.</p><p>"This is the poster for my own video line," she said. "It is called 'Sybil Danning's Adventure Video.' I do the wraparound, introducing each movie and discussing it after it is over. We're going to release four movies every two months. The first four are out in January. What I do in the wrap around is like what Elvira does with horror movies, and <a href=#>Joan Collins</a> with her video line."</p><p>"What movies will you be introducing?"</p><p>"My range is very wide. Westerns, period pictures, chase and gangster movies, something for everybody. I wear different costumes suitable to the films. For 'Space 1999,' for example, I have a silver outfit and I carry a ray gun."</p><p>"I must have missed 'Space 1999' when it came out," I said.</p><p>"Sybil comes on," Dacy said, "and says, I'm Sybil Danning. No man, no war, no country can stop me from being your host on this series! It's a little tongue-in-cheek. The response has been encouraging. We've been asked if we'll also start a cable series, but I think that's a bad idea. You want buyers to know they're getting something they couldn't get on TV. Joan Collins, for example, has actually been detrimental to video sales. Why should they pay for her when they get her free?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqmirqZe2rXnDmqWnoZ6cerHBzKmqZqGipLs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./analyzing-falkors-microarchitecture-a-deep-dive-into-qualcomms-centriq-2400-for-windows-server-and-linux.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Deep Dive into Qualcomms Centriq 2400 for Windows Server and Linux</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lydia-ko-htm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lydia Ko - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
