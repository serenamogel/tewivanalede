Action Andretti tries to make the save, but the numbers overwhelm him. Jake Hager powerbombs Starks through a table.</p><p>Page is asked whether he is cleared to compete. He says he’s not cleared today, but if he goes home and gets another brain scan, he could get cleared in time for next week, so he will be able to face Jon Moxley next week. Hangman vows to knock Moxley’s dick in the dirt. Moxley comes to the ring and says he’s tired of all the sympathy for Page. He says he has had to eat plates of crap, so he doesn’t have any sympathy for Hangman. In fact, he tells Page his complaining makes him sick.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Will <a href=#>#HangmanAdamPage</a> be ready to take on <a href=#>@JonMoxley</a> next week at <a href=#>@thekiaforum</a> in Los Angeles?</p><p>It’s <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> LIVE on TBS! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9W589buxEJ</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 5, 2023</a></p><p>Hangman counters by stating that he’s been knocked out plenty of times, so he’s not mad about that. Page says he’s angry that Moxley nearly nearly took his career from him, and he then made a joke about it. Hangman makes it clear that he’s here for revenge, and he’s going to get it next week. Moxley calls Page a punk-ass and says he’s going to make sure Page stays down next week.</p><p>Caster raps on his way to the ring and references TNA and Dixie Carter. Jarrett slaps Caster in the mouth. Bowens controls the match early pm and maintains the advantage when Lethal tags in. Caster tags in and uses the ankle lock.

Jamie Hayter says Saraya doesn’t get what AEW means to her and vice versa. Baker discusses their road to success. Baker points out that there are some great options within AEW’s women’s division, so she doesn’t understand why Saraya hasn’t picked a partner yet. She calls herself “The Pillar” and Hayter “the killer.”</p><p>In an interview, “Jungle Boy” Jack Perry discusses his feud with Big Bill and Lee Moriarty and challenges them to a tag team match where he’d join forces with HOOK.</p><p>Danielson gets a big pop from the Seattle crowd. An early distraction from Woods helps Nese take control early on. Danielson fires up with some chops and kicks. He takes Nese down with an elbow strike. Danielson drills Nese with his signature running knee strike. He stomps on Nese’s head and makes him tap out to the Regal Stretch.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Victory for the <a href=#>#AmericanDragon</a> <a href=#>@bryandanielson</a> here in Seattle, WA!</p><p>Watch <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> LIVE on TBS! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wYxkUzYsMe</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 5, 2023</a></p><p>Danielson gets a microphone and says it’s great to be home. He says he’s ready for another fight. Danielson calls out MJF, who comes out and calls him “Brain Damage Bryan.” The AEW World Champion says he doesn’t get his rocks off by wrestling, as he doesn’t care about the fans. MJF says he gets paid whether he wrestles or not. He then says Danielson is less charismatic than the hypothetical offspring of Lance Storm and Dean Malenko. He says Danielson looks like a goat, but that doesn’t mean he’s the greatest of all time. MJF implies Danielson’s mom slept with a goat. Danielson responds by saying that MJF’s mom had enough human suitors to fill the whole arena. MJF counters by saying that fans who had never been in the business made him, whereas MJF himself has been put him over by Disco Inferno, Jim Cornette, and Eric Bischoff. Danielson says he hates MJF and challenges him to a fight. MJF pumps the brakes and tells Danielson he needs to become the top contender to earn a title shot. MJF says he talked to Tony Khan, and Danielson will have to wrestle and win every week until February 8 in order to get a title shot.</p><p>Danielson initially turns him down, but he then changes his mind when MJF says he runs the company. Danielson names the stipulation of the title match, assuming he earns one: he says he’s going to face MJF in an 60-Iron Man Match. MJF accepts, and Danielson says he’s going to expose MJF. He then says he’s going to kick MJF’s head in.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=#>#AmericanDragon</a> <a href=#>@bryandanielson</a> lays out the stipulation for the <a href=#>#AEW</a> World Title match at <a href=#>#AEWRevolution</a>: A ONE-HOUR IRON MAN MATCH!!!</p><p>Watch <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> LIVE on TBS! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EBiumM0oJK</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 5, 2023</a></p><p>A video package recapped the feud between Kip Sabian and Orange Cassidy ahead of their match at AEW Battle of the Belts V.</p><p>Strickland and Fox feel each other out. They trade fast-paced offense, and the two stars match each other step for step. Fox takes control with a diving moonsault. He gets a two count with a corkscrew brainbuster. The Mogul Affiliates powerhouses intefere, and Swerve capitalizes with a stiff kick. Strickland gains the upper hand and grounds Fox. Swerve gets a two count with a Flatliner. Fox catches Strickland with a cutter and hits another one. He nails a 450 Splash for a two count. Strickland slams Fox onto the apron with an avalanche Death Valley Driver and gets the three count with the Swerve Stomp.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A vicious ending, and the victory for <a href=#>@swerveconfident</a>!</p><p>Watch <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> LIVE on TBS! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2cA7yecX7Z</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 5, 2023</a></p><p>In an interview, Saraya was sitting with Toni Storm and Hikaru Shida, and she was asked about her mystery partner for next week.

Cargill tags in and overpowers Blue. The TBS Champion continues to maintain the advantage. Cargill forcibly tags Velvet in, as it’s clear that they’re not on the same page. Jade drills Hogan and Blue with big boots. Cargill lays Hogan out with a chokeslam. Hogan rolls Cargill up for a two count, as Velvet walks out on her partner.

Joe grabs Wayne by the throat during his entrance, prompting Allin to take the fight to the champion. They brawl up to the stage. Allin dives off a ladder onto Joe and seemingly hurts his knee. The match briefly winds up in the ring before Joe and Allin head back outside. Joe slams Allin onto the steel steps. The champion grounds Allin, who can barely walk once he gets some breathing room. Allin briefly rallies, but Joe continues to viciously target Allin’s leg. Joe hits a double knee breaker, and Allin is clearly in agony. Allin counters a Muscle Buster and gets a two count with a pin attempt. The champion goes for the Coquina Clutch. Allin escapes, but Joe traps him in a chokehold. Allin hits a Code Red and nails the Coffin Drop. He hits another Coffin Drop for the win.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#AndNEW</a>!!! <a href=#>@DarbyAllin</a> is now a TWO TIME TNT Champion!</p><p>What a moment to cap off an incredible first <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> of 2023 here on TBS! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Hk0NzWNSm0</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 5, 2023</a></p><p>Sting comes to the ring and celebrates with Allin to conclude the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsbnBtaGKupsOMnbCnmZ2ewaZ50Z6qrqSkqHpyeZNmaWxlpJa0bsDIraOeZZ2WwaS0jJupspmeYrGiusieo6ynnmK2r3nAnKuip55irq%2BwjKamq50%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-saks-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Saks Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bridgette-wilson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bridgette Wilson movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
