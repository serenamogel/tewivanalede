While the P67/H67 chipset recall has proven to be a boot to the collective breadbasket of the industry, we were fortunate enough to get the Serenity SPCR Edition in before the recall hit, and Puget was kind enough to let us review it anyhow. That seems reasonable, since the SATA bug in the chipset isn't liable to affect any of our test results outside of PCMark, leaving us with an opportunity to show you a remarkable system that you'll be able to get your hands on in the near future.</p><p>Puget Systems' has also <a href=#>issued a post</a> discussing how they'll handle systems with the SNB chipset bug. The short summary is that they'll let you continue to use your system and send it in for a replacement motherboard when those become available, or they'll ship you a PCIe SATA controller to use in place of the affected SATA ports. It's a nice change of pace from the motherboard side of things, as Puget Systems will let you use your new system now, and get the problem fixed in the next few months with a minimum of hassle. With that out of the way, let's look at the system we received for review.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4155/s-face.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Puget Systems' Serenity line of computers are designed to maximize silent operation, with the SPCR Edition being the quietest system in their lineup. This tower is designed in cooperation with Silent PC Review and independently certified by them to run at a staggeringly low 11db; the regular Serenity models have a noise ceiling of 20db, which is still impressively quiet. If you're wondering whether the Serenity SPCR lives up to that claim, we can't tell you: the unit is inaudible unless you put your ear against the side (even under heavy load), and operates below the noise floor of my apartment at any hour. Simply put, we're not equipped to measure the noise level of something this quiet. So how is our review unit outfitted?</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=565><tbody readability=24.883177570093><tr readability=2><td align=center class=contentwhite colspan=2><strong>Puget Systems Serenity SPCR Edition Specifications</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chassis</strong></td><td>Antec P183 (Customized)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3.3GHz<br>(spec: 4x3.3GHz, 32nm, 6MB L3, 95W)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Motherboard</strong></td><td>ASUS P8P67 Pro Motherboard with P67 chipset</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>2x4GB Kingston HyperX DDR3-1333 @ 1333MHz (expandable to 16GB)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>PowerColor Radeon HD 5750 1024MB GDDR5 with Passive Cooler<br>(720 Stream Processors, 700MHz Core, 4.6GHz RAM, 128-bit memory bus)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Hard Drive(s)</strong></td><td>Intel X25-M 34nm Gen 2 120GB SSD<br>Western Digital Caviar Green 1.5TB</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Optical Drive(s)</strong></td><td>ASUS DVD+/-RW Combo Drive</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Intel Gigabit Ethernet<br>Bluetooth 2.1+EDR</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Audio</strong></td><td>Realtek ALC892 HD Audio<br>Speaker, mic, line-in, and surround jacks for 7.1 sound<br>Digital and optical out</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Front Side</strong></td><td>Optical Drive<br>2x USB 2.0<br>eSATA<br>Headphone and mic jacks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Top</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Back Side</strong></td><td>2x PS/2<br>Digital and optical out<br>2x eSATA<br>6x USB 2.0<br>6-pin FireWire<br>Ethernet<br>2x USB 3.0<br>Speaker, mic, line-in, and surround jacks for 7.1 sound</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td><td>19.9" x 20.25" x 8.1" (WxDxH)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>31 lbs (case only)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Extras</strong></td><td>Antec CP-850 850W Power Supply<br>Gelid Tranquilo CPU Cooler<br>Scythe Silent Fans<br>Silent Case Modification</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Warranty</strong></td><td>1-year limited warranty and lifetime phone support</td></tr><tr readability=3.6470588235294><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td>SPCR Edition starts at <a href=#>$1,550</a><br>Review system quoted at $2,149</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For most of this review we were able to handpick and outfit the tower with the components of our choice; as a result the Intel Core i5-2500K we chose didn't ship overclocked and Puget Systems doesn't offer overclocking on this model (though you can still do it yourself). By now you already know that <a href=#>Sandy Bridge processors</a> are the fastest clock-for-clock on the market, and also among the most efficient (which our thermal and power consumption testing will bear out).</p><p>If you're a little bit underwhelmed by the Radeon HD 5750 in our review unit, don't be. This 5750 is arguably the fastest passively-cooled card on the market (only the Sparkle GTS 450 really competes), and is included in this build for what should be obvious reasons. Our rep did tell us that a passively-cooled Radeon HD 6850 is in the works right now; when that becomes available expect it to be offered with the Serenity SPCR Edition. That said, just because it's fanless doesn't mean it's slower: this 5750 runs at spec.</p><p>As for the parts we didn't choose, most of them make sense, though the lack of a card reader is disappointing when most of the review units we've seen include one as a matter of course. An SSD is a shoo-in with no moving parts to produce noise—though you could argue for using a SandForce-based drive instead of the Intel one—and the inclusion of the Western Digital Caviar Green sacrifices some performance in the name of silent running. A basic DVD+/-RW combo drive instead of a Blu-ray drive was disappointing, but the upgrades are at least available for a reasonable price. Puget Systems claims on their website to test individual components and cherry pick them and I can believe it. And finally, a brief thumbs up for including 8GB of DDR3 instead of 4GB in the review unit. This really should be standard and it's perplexing why so many of our review towers don't ship with 8GB at this point.</p><p>Finally, wrapping everything up is the Antec P183 enclosure. The P183 is often regarded as among the quietest cases available, but as you'll see Puget Systems takes it a few steps further in the name of silent operation. If I could really complain about anything, the Antec CP-850 power supply seems like gross overkill for a machine with specs this modest. You'll see in our power consumption testing that it's not really an issue, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIFygZRop66flal6tMXSrZymq12osrOxzaKrsmWjpbCzecSdoK2hn6M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shonda-rhimes-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-greys-anatomy-creator-in-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shonda Rhimes Net Worth: How Rich Is the Greys Anatomy Creator?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-was-star-wars-filmed-10-locations-star-wars-fans-can-visit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where was Star Wars filmed? 10 locations Star Wars fans can visit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gary-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277216-html.html>Gary Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sion Sono movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kayla-maisonet-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Kayla Maisonet Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-chips-2021-live-blog-machine-learning-esperanto-enflame-qualcomm.html>Machine Learning (Esperanto, Enflame, Qualcomm)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tata-harper-hydrating-floral-face-mask.html>Shoppers Say This Hyaluronic Acid Face Mask Leaves Skin Plump</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakDash.
