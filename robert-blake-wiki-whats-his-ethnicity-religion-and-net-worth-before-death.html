In 1936, Robert and his siblings debuted as “The Three Little Hillbillies.” The family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1938, where the late singer and his siblings worked as movie extras.</p><p>Blake had a difficult upbringing. His father, an alcoholic, mistreated him. At the age of ten, the star of In Cold Blood started attending a public school, where he was ridiculed and got into confrontations with other children. As a consequence, he was kicked out.&nbsp;Blake once claimed that as a youngster, both of his parents physically and sexually assaulted him and that they often punished him by putting him in a closet and forcing him to eat food off the floor.

After having two children with his first wife, Sondra Kerr, the In Cold Blood actor divorced her in 1983. In 1999, he began dating Bonnie Lee Bakley, whom he met a few years before.
